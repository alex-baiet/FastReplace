# FastReplace

*FastReplace* is a small application allowing the user to replace a folder by another without having the hassle of removing the *whole* ancient folder and then copying the *whole* new folder, which can be very long for heavy folders.

FastReplace compare the content of the new and old folder, then copy and remove specific files to obtain the same result than removing and copying everything, but by being far faster than the previous method.

## How to use

Specify the **source directory** to copy and the **destination folder** to replace, then press "**Start**". Just wait a bit and the replacement is done !
